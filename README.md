*Hello, fellow friend!! *![Image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Fire.JPG)
  This is a retrospection of my journey compliting this frontend mentor project, equiped it with some Backend(for the login button I added a simple POST request, for when it's clicked, it appears a model with a message that comes from backend)
  
__What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?__

**Deploying this website** was my best accomplishment of all, it took me a whole day to understand and make this work; i will enter in more detailed in the next section! I also learned:
- `overflow` set to `clip` instead of hidden for hiding scrolling because hidden has a lot of **unwanted results**, and it gets very tedious and difficult to work with
- learning and applying **React Query** is a game changer where it comes to fetching data from back-end to front-end. This is the easiest door to open between front-end and back-end rooms
- *practising* the full-stack overflow is relaxing, but i am not satisfied i couldn't apply like almost anything that i learn about back-end
  
__What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?__

Deploying a **full-stack** application was a real nightmare at first! Even now, I don‚Äôt fully understand why some of my older projects (on GitHub) deployed so smoothly while this one was so challenging.

For this deployment, I had to complete two mini-deployments:

1.    Deploying the Back-end.
2.    Deploying the Front-end.

Getting the `.env` files for each part right was tricky‚Äîit felt like I had to predict the exact URLs they would live on. But with patience and a bit of trial and error, I figured it out!

Render turned out to be a fantastic platform for deployment. 
I hope this little ‚Äúmini-documentary‚Äù helps anyone struggling with similar issues. Even if you‚Äôre only **deploying a React app**, 
just focus on the front-end part‚Äîit took me a few days to learn how to deploy React when I first started, so hang in there!

__What specific areas of your project would you like help with?__
Testing on **two different computers** made me realize that the **website doesn‚Äôt always look the same**. It seems like browser settings can significantly affect how the site appears and behaves, which was surprising to me.

**If you have any advice on how to handle this and create more consistent, accessible websites, I‚Äôd be so grateful! üòä**
